    I do not know everything and what I say in this document and repository is the result of my experience and learning.
    It could miss some important features and notions.
    In this case, please open an issue or pull-request to improve it.

    I have a very opinionated view of components for <strong>final projects</strong>.
    Mostly, I am against fully configurable components that all leaked to technical debt in my experience.
    This opinion will impact lots of the design of components.
    I try to give the reasons of my decisions so you can form your own opinion.
    I am open to discussion, so do not hesitate to contact me or open issues.
