  <p>
    When designing components, following general rules applies.
  </p>

  <h3>Be as restrictive as possible</h3>

  <p>
    Give the least possibilities to the developer to change the component.
    As soon as you give them some freedom, they will take it and transform the logic of the component.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, imagine a <code>button</code> component.
    You accept a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> for the content of the component.
    Also, you accept a <code>class</code> attribute so the developer can style the button as s·he wants.
    What will happen?
  </p>

  <p>
    Some structure will be duplicated (ex: button with icon, colors, sizes) and not always the same way.
    Even though some developers will try to factorize button styles, there will always a case where it is not done
    right.
    When you would want to change some style, you will end up changing the whole application.
  </p>

  <p>
    To avoid this case, the only thing to do is to restrict the developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    And by doing so, you also force the designer to be aware of the restriction.
    When the developer will have an impossibility to make changes without changing the component,
    it will be an alert to check whether the design is coherent with the existing.
    And if so, the component should be rethought.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only when an abstraction can be made and a restrictive one, you can update the component to accept this abstraction.
    For example, our button can be an <code>icon-button</code> but the <code>icon</code> name can be given by the
    parent.
  </p>

  <h3>Use of css-variables</h3>

  <p>
    We use a lot of css-variables.
    Not because they are cool (even if they are) but because they help to define several stylesheets.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, if you want to see with your designer the configuration of the component,
    you can use a simple UI-kit like <code>uikit.html</code>.
    Also, if you want to define several stylesheets (day/night modes, accessibility mode, …),
    it will be easier to have all your variables in a global definition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, these exist for specific use case and can be simplified or extended depending on your own needs.
    They mainly exist for demonstration purpose.
  </p>

  <h3>Lots of configurations</h3>

  <p>
    In this page, you will surely think that each component have lots of configurations (and too many).
    The reason behind it it to show the developer and designer all cases to take into account.
    In your final application, maybe you will only make little variables configurable.
  </p>

  <p>
    This repository exists to help you create your UI-kit,
    so the final components should be simpler in terms of configuration.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, if you need several stylesheets (eg: night mode), please take into account all cases too.
