  <h2 id="about">About this project</h2>

  <p>
    The objective of this project is not to give a complete set of components ready to use in production.
    Instead, it focuses on best practices (structure, i18n, a11y, tips) to build valid components.
  </p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="disclaimer">
  <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

  <p>
    I do not know everything and what I say in this document and repository is the result of my experience and learning.
    It could miss some important features and notions.
    In this case, please open an issue or pull-request to improve it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a very opinionated view of components for <strong>final projects</strong>.
    Mostly, I am against fully configurable components that all leaked to technical debt in my experience.
    This opinion will impact lots of the design of components.
    I try to give the reasons of my decisions so you can form your own opinion.
    I am open to discussion, so do not hesitate to contact me or open issues.
  </p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="general-design">
  <h2 id="general-design">General design</h2>

  <p>
    When designing components, following general rules applies.
  </p>

  <h3>Be as restrictive as possible</h3>

  <p>
    Give the least possibilities to the developer to change the component.
    As soon as you give them some freedom, they will take it and transform the logic of the component.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, imagine a <code>button</code> component.
    You accept a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> for the content of the component.
    Also, you accept a <code>class</code> attribute so the developer can style the button as s·he wants.
    What will happen?
  </p>

  <p>
    Some structure will be duplicated (ex: button with icon, colors, sizes) and not always the same way.
    Even though some developers will try to factorize button styles, there will always a case where it is not done
    right.
    When you would want to change some style, you will end up changing the whole application.
  </p>

  <p>
    To avoid this case, the only thing to do is to restrict the developer.

  </p>

  <p>
    And by doing so, you also force the designer to be aware of the restriction.
    When the developer will have an impossibility to make changes without changing the component,
    it will be an alert to check whether the design is coherent with the existing.
    And if so, the component should be rethought.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only when an abstraction can be made and a restrictive one, you can update the component to accept this abstraction.
    For example, our button can be an <code>icon-button</code> but the <code>icon</code> name can be given by the
    parent.
  </p>

  <h3>Use of css-variables</h3>

  <p>
    We use a lot of css-variables.
    Not because they are cool (even if they are) but because they help to define several stylesheets.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, if you want to see with your designer the configuration of the component,
    you can use a simple UI-kit like <code>uikit.html</code>.
    Also, if you want to define several stylesheets (day/night modes, accessibility mode, …),
    it will be easier to have all your variables in a global definition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, these exist for specific use case and can be simplified or extended depending on your own needs.
    They mainly exist for demonstration purpose.
  </p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="atomo-button">
  <h2 id="atomo-button">Button</h2>

  <p>
    Represents a clickable element to trigger a specific action.
  </p>

  <h3>How to configure it</h3>

  <h4>Types of buttons</h4>

  <p>
    Before configuring the component, list all types of buttons you have in your application.
    Here some examples (non-exhaustive):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Submit</li>
    <li>Cancel</li>
    <li>Previous</li>
    <li>Next</li>
    <li>Share</li>
    <li>Add</li>
    <li>Remove</li>
    <li>Mute</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>States of buttons</h4>

  <p>
    Each type of button can have several states (non-exhaustive and some could be non-relevant in your case):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Default</li>
    <li>
      Manual states:
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled (when the button cannot be clicked <code>:disabled</code>)</li>
        <li>Pressed (for buttons having two distinct states like a mute button, <code>[aria-pressed]</code>)</li>
        <li>Error (when the action did not end well, <code>.error</code>)</li>
        <li>Success (when the action did end well, <code>.success</code>)</li>
        <li>Warning (when the action ended but with a warning, <code>.warning</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Browser states:
      <ul>
        <li>Hover (non existing in phone and tablet, <code>:hover</code>)</li>
        <li>Active (when clicking but not released, <code>:active</code>)</li>
        <li>Focused (as an input, not always existing, <code>:focus</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    ⚠️ Technically, these states could be mixed in between the manual state and the browser state.
    When implementing styles and behavior, be aware of these edge cases.
    For instance, while your button is <em>pressed</em> (with toggle button), the user can <em>active</em> it too.
    The choice of which style overrides the other is up to you.
  </p>

  <h4>Difference between <em>type</em> and <em>state</em></h4>

  <p>
    The difference between <em>type</em> and <em>state</em> could not be obvious.
    However, there is a fundamental difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    A type of button cannot change during the use of the application.
    The <em>next</em> button will always be the <em>next</em> button.
    It cannot transform into a <em>previous</em> or <em>share</em> button.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, its state can change.
    The <em>next</em> button can be <em>disabled</em> while the form is invalid.
    Then it becomes <em>active</em> and once the form sent, be <em>error</em> or <em>success</em> depending on the
    result.
  </p>

  <p>
    Said simply: the <em>type</em> never change but the <em>state</em> does.
  </p>

  <h4>In this project</h4>

  <p>
    We determined two categories for buttons: <code>text-button</code> and <code>icon-button</code>.
    The first one will be used for text buttons with an optional icon and the other for icon-only buttons.
    This choice could be convenient or not to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    To add types in the text categories, go to <code>button/api.ts</code> and change <code>textButtonTypes</code>.
    For the icon category, the code directly uses <code>iconTypes</code> from <code>icon/api.ts</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To add states in all categories, go to <code>button/api.ts</code> and change <code>states</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To change the style of the button, look at <code>AtomoTextButton.renderStyles</code> and <code>AtomoIconButton.renderStyles</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Available css variables are the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>--cursor</code></li>
    <li><code>--border-radius</code></li>
    <li><code>--padding</code></li>
    <li><code>--font-weight</code></li>
    <li><code>--font-size</code></li>
    <li><code>--transition</code></li>
    <li><code>--{type}-background</code>: Background color in normal state</li>
    <li><code>--{type}-color</code>: Text color in normal state</li>
    <li><code>--{type}-border</code>: Border in normal state</li>
    <li><code>--{type}-background-{state}</code>: Background color in {state} state</li>
    <li><code>--{type}-color-{state}</code>: Text color in {state} state</li>
    <li><code>--{type}-border-{state}</code>: Border in {state} state</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Update the code with your own needs for more control.
  </p>

  <h3>Internationalization</h3>

  <p>
    If you want to use or update the component, think about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Colors: The meaning per country and region</li>
    <li>Icons and their position: In left-to-right texts, right-to-left texts…</li>
    <li>Labels (shown and hidden)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>

  <p>
    If you want to use or update the component, think about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A label for button without text
      (ex: for screen readers,
      a <code>title</code> attribute could be enough using firefox dev tools but need confirmation)
    </li>
    <li>Colors and contrast of buttons (ex: for people with visual disabilities)</li>
    <li>Discriminants for different button types (ex: different colors for colorblind people)</li>
    <li>Size of button (ex: mobiles)</li>
    <li>Usage of html attributes (<code>disabled</code>, <code>type</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Best practices</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h3 class="do">Do</h3>

      <h4 class="do">One component per category</h4>

      <p>
        Like done with <code>atomo-button</code>, you can have one button component per category.
        For instance, you can have a <code>text-button</code> and an <code>icon-button</code>.
        Each category will render the button in some way that could be very different from one another.
        It will differs from <code>type</code> which styles will be small enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, the <code>icon-button</code> could hide the label (but keep it for accessibility reasons) and have
        a circular form.
        Then the type could define the shown icon and its background-color.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the contrary, the <code>text-button</code> could always show the label, have an optional icon and have a
        rectangular form.
        Then the type could define the color and background-color and the icon to show.
      </p>

      <h4 class="do">Use specific names</h4>

      <p>
        Usage of specific names like <code>submis</code> or <code>cancel</code> gives more information of how to use them.
        Use them and multiply them, it will simplify the decision of a type or state for future developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Framework often use terms like <code>primary</code> and <code>secondary</code>.
        If they have meanings for you, keep them.
        Otherwise, do not hesitate to change them to names that have meaning for your project.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      <h3 class="dont">Don't</h3>

      <h4 class="dont">Give the possibility to add an external class name</h4>

      <p>
        If you give this possibility, developers will use it and duplicate logic.
        Also, it will bring inconsistency in you application.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a button need a specific style, check if it enters in a defined category and if a type can be defined.
        In the other case, check if it is a new category and other buttons enter into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prefer checking with a designer before adding a type of button.
        It could be a mistake or a new notion that could be made explicit.
      </p>

      <h4 class="dont">Use a button as a link</h4>

      <p>
        Do not use a <code>button</code> that should behave like a link (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>).
        A button means doing an action and a link means going to a page.
        An action can redirect to a page but as a side effect of the action, not as the objective.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need a link rendered as a button, create a new component using to use html <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
        Whether you define this component as a button or a link is your choice.
        However, the technical element should remains semantically valid.
      </p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Example</h3>

  <h4>Text buttons</h4>

  <atomo-text-button type="submit" state="normal" label="Cancel"></atomo-text-button>
  <atomo-text-button type="cancel" state="normal" label="Add" left-icon="plus"></atomo-text-button>
  <atomo-text-button type="previous" state="normal" label="Add" right-icon="plus"></atomo-text-button>
  <atomo-text-button type="next" state="normal" label="Add" left-icon="plus" right-icon="plus"></atomo-text-button>
  <atomo-text-button type="submit" state="disabled" label="disabled"></atomo-text-button>

  <h4>Icon buttons</h4>

  <atomo-icon-button type="plus" state="normal" label="Add something"></atomo-icon-button>
  <atomo-icon-button type="plus" state="disabled" label="Add something"></atomo-icon-button>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="atomo-icon">
  <h2 id="atomo-icon">Icon</h2>

  <p>Shows an icon with different sizes</p>

  <h3>How to configure it</h3>

  <h4>Sizes</h4>

  <p>
    Update type <code>IconSize</code> in <code>icon/api.ts</code> with your own list of sizes.
    Then update the mapping <code>sizes</code> in <code>icon/icon.ts</code>.
  </p>

  <h4>Icon format</h4>

  <p>
    Sometimes, you can have several formats for your icon (white / black, primary / secondary, …).
    You can either declare the variants as a different type (ex: <code>&lt;icon type="plus-white"&gt;</code>)
    or as a type with a variant (ex: <code>&lt;icon type="plus" variant="white"&gt;</code>).
  </p>

  <h4>Declaration of icons</h4>

  <p>
    This project uses a simple javascript function returning a <code>svg</code> element (with <code>lit-html</code>).
    However, it is not an obligation and will depends on several causes (tooling, technical format of the icon, …).
  </p>

  <h3>Internationalization</h3>

  <p>
    If you want to use or update the component, think about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Colors and forms: The meaning per country and region</li>
    <li>Give a translated title and a description to your icon</li>
    <li>Avoid using icons without another text to describe them (or make the context explicit)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>

  <p>
    If you want to use or update the component, think about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Clear label and description for your icon (title and description in svg, alt text for image)</li>
    <li>Colors and contrast of icons and their usage in other components (ex: buttons)</li>
    <li>Size of the icon</li>
    <li>Having icon different enough to avoid confusion</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Best practices</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h3 class="do">Do</h3>

      <h4 class="do">Prefer SVG</h4>

      <p>
        Prefer SVG over other formats.
        You can give information like a title and a description readable by screen readers.
        They can be stylized with css without be forced to create another file.
        Also, they often end up having a lower size.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      <h3 class="dont">Don't</h3>

      <h4 class="dont">Replace all texts with icons</h4>

      <p>
        Icons give graphical information and help with people with dyslexia.
        However, they also remove clear information that a text can bring.
        Prefer having both (icon and text) instead of only icons.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Example</h3>

  <atomo-icon type="plus" size="small" description="Add nothing for the example"></atomo-icon>
  <atomo-icon type="plus" size="medium" description="Add nothing for the example"></atomo-icon>
  <atomo-icon type="plus" size="large" description="Add nothing for the example"></atomo-icon>
